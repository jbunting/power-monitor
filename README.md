# Power Monitor  

This is a simple power monitor that I put together for monitoring my house. It includes an esphome configuration and an easyeda circuit & pcb layout.

## Context

I have 2 200 amp panels feeding my house that sit right next to each other. I also have an electrical outlet that sits right below the panels. This therefore supports 4 CT Clamps (one for each leg of each panel) and a single 9V AC/AC transformer for measuring voltage. I make the assumption that voltage is the same on all 4 legs.
